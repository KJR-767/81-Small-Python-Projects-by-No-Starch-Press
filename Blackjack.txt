Made some simple mistakes with indents and also a simple mistake at the end of the code.

# I had a space before the underscore at the start.

if __name__ == ' __main__':

# Very simple correction but took about 10 mins to figure this out.

if __name__ == '__main__':

The code did not run atall with this error as the main function was not 
being called as it was spelled wrong.

Enjoyed writing this and i have a few ideas, i would love to implement this into a nice UI with interactive elements and 
make an actual minigame out of this the default cards are functional but very crude, some nice cards drawn in photoshop
would be a idea.
