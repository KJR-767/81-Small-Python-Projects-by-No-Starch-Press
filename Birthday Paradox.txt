(Using a Tuple over a List)

On line 28 i have used a tuple instead of a list, This is because 
Tuples are faster than lists.

Using a tuple Write-Protects the data so that it does not have to 
be changed because the data need to stay constant.

The main difference is that a tuple is immutable so its cant be changed 
in place after assignment, on the otehr hand a list is mutable, this means you can append,
change, subtract and use other methods on it.
