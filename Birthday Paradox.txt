(Using a Tuple over a List)

On line 28 i have used a tuple instead of a list, This is because 
Tuples are faster than lists.

Using a tuple Write-Protects the data so that it does not have to 
be changed because the data need to stay constant.

The main difference is that a tuple is immutable so its cant be changed 
in place after assignment, on the otehr hand a list is mutable, this means you can append,
change, subtract and use other methods on it.

I had a problem with the code below, this is the fixed version.

print('Let\'s run another 100,000 simulations.')
simMatch = 0 
for i in range(100000):
    if i % 10000 == 0:
        print(i, 'simulations run...')
    birthdays = getBirthdays(numBDays)
    if getMatch(birthdays) != None:
        simMatch = simMatch + 1
print('100,000 simulations run.')

There was an indentation error but took a long time for me to fix, originally i had 
typed the following.

print('Let\'s run another 100,000 simulations.')
simMatch = 0 
for i in range(100000):
    if i % 10000 == 0:
        print(i, 'simulations run...')
        birthdays = getBirthdays(numBDays)
        if getMatch(birthdays) != None:
            simMatch = simMatch + 1
print('100,000 simulations run.')

Very simple problem but it was a very time consuming issue, in future take more time to 
read the code before moving to the next block of code.
